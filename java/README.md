# Java bindings for FollowTheMoney 

This folder contains basic Java bindings for FtM. They're not meant to be full data 
generating bindings (e.g. they lack type validation logic), but merely make it easier
to process existing FtM data in a JVM environment.

It's written in Java to get access to the JVM world without picking sides in any 
Scala vs. Kotlin vs. .... battle. Boring technology.
