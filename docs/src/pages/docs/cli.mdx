# Command-Line Functions

Many of the functions of _followthemoney_ can be used interactively or in scripts via the command line. Please first refer to the [Aleph documentation](https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/developers/followthemoney/ftm) for an intro to the `ftm` utility.

Key to understanding the `ftm` tool is the notion of [streams](/docs#streams): entities can be transferred between programs and processing steps as a series of JSON objects, one per line. This notion is supported by the related [alephclient](https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/developers/alephclient) command, which can serve as a source, and a sink for entity streams, backed by the Aleph API.

## Examples

The command line sequence below uses shell pipes to a) [map data](/docs/mappings) into entities from a database, b) apply a [namespace](/docs/namespace) to the entity IDs, c) aggregate [entity fragments](/docs/fragments) created by the mapping, and d) export the resulting entity stream into a sequence of CYPHER statements that can be executed on a Neo4J database to generate a property graph:

```bash
ftm map companies_from_db.yml | \
    ftm sign -s my_namespace | \
    ftm aggregate | \
    ftm export-cypher -o graph.cypher
```

Here's another example that fetches pre-generated entities from a URL and loads
them into a local Aleph instance:

```bash
export URL=https://public.data.occrp.org/datasets/icij/panama_papers.ijson
curl -s $URL | \
    ftm validate | \
    alephclient write-entities -f icij_panama_papers
```

## Reference

Please refer to the output of `ftm --help` for a detailed reference of the `ftm` CLI:
