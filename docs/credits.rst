* The `Popolo data standard`_ developed by an alliance of open data activists is the
  foundation of `followthemoney`. It provides the origin of key entities, including
  :ref:`schema-Person`, :ref:`schema-Organization` and :ref:`schema-Membership`.
* Popolo is implemented by `EveryPolitician`_, establishing a practical reference. 
* `Dr. Amy Guy`_ took an essential role in breaking `followthemoney` out of Aleph
  and introducing the current entity-based model.
