# Credits

- The [Popolo data standard](https://www.popoloproject.com/) developed by an alliance of open data activists is the foundation of _followthemoney_. It provides the origin of key entities, including `schema:Person`, `schema:Organization` and `schema:Membership`.
- Popolo is implemented by [EveryPolitician](http://everypolitician.org/), establishing a practical reference.
- [Dr. Amy Guy](http://rhiaro.co.uk/) took an essential role in breaking _followthemoney_ out of Aleph and introducing the current entity-based model.
