Interval:
  # FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL IN THIS UNVERSE:
  #
  # Intervals are not graph edges.
  #
  # Yes, many interval child schemata (e.g. Directorship, Ownership) can
  # be interpreted as an edge between to Things. But that isn't intrinsic.
  # If you write any code that assumes that Intervals == edges, it will
  # be buggy and wrong. You will find there are intervals that link to
  # only one thing (e.g. Sanction) or to much more than two (e.g. FEA).
  # Just do not do it.
