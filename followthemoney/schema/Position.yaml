  description: >
    A post, role or position within an organization or body.
    This describes a position one or more people may occupy
    and not the occupation of the post by a specific individual at a
    specific point in time.

    'subnationalArea' should be used to further restrict the scope of the
    position. It should not simply represent some regional aspect of the
    role - e.g. the constituency of a national member of parliament - when
    their legislative jurisdiction is nationwide.
